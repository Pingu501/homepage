## About

This page is a quite simple page to introduce myself to others.

## Technologies

I was thinking a long time about using react for this, but I think this would be a big overkill.
Still I really wanted to use it, so here we go! :)

React might be too large for this simple page, it is still a fun way to create pages and web applications.
Also I wanted to use react fiber!
